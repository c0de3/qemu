##
# @ThrottleLimits:
#
# Limit parameters for throttling.
# Since some limit combinations are illegal, limits should always be set in one
# transaction. All fields are optional. When setting limits, if a field is
# missing the current value is not changed.
#
# @bps: total throughput limit in bytes per second
#
# @bps_rd: read throughput limit in bytes per second
#
# @bps_wr: write throughput limit in bytes per second
#
# @iops: total I/O operations per second
#
# @iops_rd: read I/O operations per second
#
# @iops_wr: write I/O operations per second
#
# @bps_max: total throughput limit during bursts,
#                     in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# @bps_rd_max: read throughput limit during bursts,
#                        in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# @bps_wr_max: write throughput limit during bursts,
#                        in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# @iops_max: total I/O operations per second during bursts,
#                      in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# @iops_rd_max: read I/O operations per second during bursts,
#                         in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# @iops_wr_max: write I/O operations per second during bursts,
#                         in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# @bps_max_length: maximum length of the @bps_max burst
#                            period, in seconds. It must only
#                            be set if @bps_max is set as well.
#                            Defaults to 1. (Since 2.6)
#
# @bps_rd_max_length: maximum length of the @bps_rd_max
#                               burst period, in seconds. It must only
#                               be set if @bps_rd_max is set as well.
#                               Defaults to 1. (Since 2.6)
#
# @bps_wr_max_length: maximum length of the @bps_wr_max
#                               burst period, in seconds. It must only
#                               be set if @bps_wr_max is set as well.
#                               Defaults to 1. (Since 2.6)
#
# @iops_max_length: maximum length of the @iops burst
#                             period, in seconds. It must only
#                             be set if @iops_max is set as well.
#                             Defaults to 1. (Since 2.6)
#
# @iops_rd_max_length: maximum length of the @iops_rd_max
#                                burst period, in seconds. It must only
#                                be set if @iops_rd_max is set as well.
#                                Defaults to 1. (Since 2.6)
#
# @iops_wr_max_length: maximum length of the @iops_wr_max
#                                burst period, in seconds. It must only
#                                be set if @iops_wr_max is set as well.
#                                Defaults to 1. (Since 2.6)
#
# @iops_size: an I/O size in bytes (Since 1.7)
#
# Since: 3.2
