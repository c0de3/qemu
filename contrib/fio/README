This is a plugin to test the QEMU block layer with fio,
the flexible I/O tester.

To build this plugin you have to:

1) hack the configure file to use -fPIC instead of -fPIE

2) configure qemu with --enable-pie

3) build the plugin with

	make qemu-img
	make -C contrib/fio FIO_PATH=/path/to/fio/source
