QEMU Seccomp system call filter
===============================

Starting from QEMU version 2.11, the seccomp filter does not work as a
whitelist but as a blacklist instead. This method allows safer deploys since
only the strictly forbidden system calls will be black-listed and the
possibility of breaking any workload is close to zero.

The default option (-sandbox on) has a slightly looser security though and the
reason is that it shouldn't break any backwards compatibility with previous
deploys and command lines already running. But if the intent is to have a
better security from this version on, one should make use of the following
additional options properly:

* obsolete=allow|deny: It allows Qemu to run safely on old system that still
  relies on old system calls.

* elevateprivileges=allow|deny|children: It allows or denies Qemu process
  to elevate its privileges by blacklisting all set*uid|gid system calls. The
  'children' option sets the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS to 1 which allows helpers
  (forks and execs) to run unprivileged.

* spawn=allow|deny: It blacklists fork and execve system calls, avoiding QEMU to
  spawn new threads or processes.

* resourcecontrol=allow|deny: It blacklists all process affinity and scheduler
  priority system calls to avoid that the process can increase its amount of
  allowed resource consumption.
