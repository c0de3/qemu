3270 devices
============

With the aid of the ``x3270`` emulator, QEMU provides limited support
for making a single 3270 device available to a guest. Note that this
supports basic features only.

To provide a 3270 device to a guest, create a ``x-3270device`` linked to
a ``tn3270`` chardev. The guest will see a 3270 channel device. In order
to actually be able to use it, attach the ``x3270`` emulator to the chardev.

Example configuration
---------------------

* Add a ``tn3270`` chardev and a ``x-3270device`` to the QEMU command line::

    -chardev socket,id=char_0,host=0.0.0.0,port=23,nowait,server,tn3270
    -device x-terminal3270,chardev=char_0,devno=fe.0.000a,id=terminal_0

* Start the guest. In the guest, use ``chccwdev -e 0.0.000a`` to enable
  the device.

* On the host, start the ``x3270`` emulator::

    x3270 <host>:23

* In the guest, locate the 3270 device node under ``/dev/3270/`` (say,
  ``tty1``) and start a getty on it::

    systemctl start serial-getty@3270-tty1.service

This should get you an addtional tty for logging into the guest.
