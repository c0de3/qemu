prebuilt firmware in qemu
=========================

The process of building firmware isn't as easy as building qemu
itself, for example because you must have cross compilers installed
when building firmware for other architectures.  So qemu ships
prebuilt firmware binaries for convenience reasons.


directories
-----------

pc-bios/
    Firmware binaries.
    Also other files like keymaps and logos which are copied to
    $prefix/share/qemu by "make install".

pc-bios/optionrom/
    Firmware sources, part of the qemu project.

roms/
    Firmware sources, third-party projects, as git submodules.


third-party git repos
---------------------

For third party firmware sources it is recommended to have a git
mirror on git.qemu.org.  In case the firmware license is GPL the git
mirror is mandatory for GPL compilance reasons:  We ship binaries, so
we must provide sources too.


building the firmware
---------------------

Firmware builds should be done using rules in roms/Makefile.  That
serves as documentation how the firmware is built, and it also makes
firmware updates easier for the maintainer.

"make -C roms" prints a list of firmware build targets.
"make -C roms $target" kicks a build.
