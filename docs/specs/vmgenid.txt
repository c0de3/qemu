The VM generation ID (vmgenid) device is an emulated device which
exposes a 128-bit, cryptographically random, integer value identifier.
This allows management applications (e.g. libvirt) to notify the guest
operating system when the virtual machine is executed with a different
configuration (e.g. snapshot execution or creation from a template).

The vmgenid device is a sysbus device with the ACPI ID "QEMUGVID".

The device has one properties, which can be set using the command line
argument or the QMP interface:
 guid - sets the value of the GUID.  A special value "auto" instructs
        QEMU to generate a new random GUID.
For example:
QEMU  -device vmgenid,guid="324e6eaf-d1d1-4bf6-bf41-b9bb6c91fb87"

Or to change guid in runtime use:
 set-vm-generation-id guid=124e6eaf-d1d1-4bf6-bf41-b9bb6c91fb87
 set-vm-generation-id guid=auto

According to the specification, any change to the GUID executes an
ACPI notification. The vmgenid device triggers the \_GPE._E05 handler
which executes the ACPI Notify operation.

Although not specified in Microsoft's document, it is assumed that the
device is expected to use the little-endian system.
