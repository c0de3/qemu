 *
 * - Mode :: user
 *   Triggered in QEMU user application emulation (e.g., linux-user).
 *
 * - Mode :: softmmy
 *   Triggered in QEMU full-system emulation.
 *
 *
 * - Targets :: all
 *   Triggered on all targets, both using TCG or native hardware virtualization
 *   (e.g., KVM).
 *
 * - Targets :: TCG(<arch>)
 *   Triggered on the given guest target architectures when executing with TCG
 *   (no native hardware virtualization).
 *
 *
 * - Time :: exec
 *   Triggered when the guest executes the described operation.
 *
 * - Time :: trans
 *   Triggered when QEMU translates a guest operation. This is only available
 *   when executing with TCG. Guest instructions are decompiled and translated
 *   into the intermediate TCG language (when "Time: trans" events are
 *   triggered). Then, the TCG compiler translates TCG code into the native host
 *   code that QEMU will execute to emulate the guest (when "Time: exec" events
 *   are triggered). As QEMU uses a cache of translated code, the same
 *   instruction might be translated more than once (when the cache overflows).
