If you have a support question that is not answered by our
[documentation](/documentation) you have a number of options available
to you.

If the question is specifically about the integration of QEMU with the
rest of your distribution you may be better served by asking through
your distribution's support channels. This includes questions about a
specifically packaged versions of QEMU. The developers are generally
concerned with the latest release and the current state of the [master
branch](https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git).

Questions about complex configurations of networking and storage are
usually met with a recommendation to use management tool like
[virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) from the [libvirt
project](https://libvirt.org/) to configure and run QEMU.

* There is a
[qemu-discuss@nongnu.org](https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-discuss)
mailing list for user focused questions<br>
If your question is more technical or architecture specific you may
want to send your question to another of [QEMU's mailing
lists](https://wiki.qemu.org/MailingLists)

* A lot of developers hang around on IRC (network: irc.oftc.net,
channel #qemu)<br> QEMU developers tend to hold normal office hours
and are distributed around the world. Please be patient as you may
have to wait some time for a response. If you can't leave IRC open and
wait you may be better served by a mailing list.

* If you think you have found a bug you can report it on [our bug
  tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/)<br>
Please see our guide on [how to report a bug](/contribute/report-a-bug/)
